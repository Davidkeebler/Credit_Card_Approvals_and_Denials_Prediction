    "# Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "This project attempts to create the best possible binary classification model that can predict whether or not a given individual will qualify for a new credit card based on 17 factors. The data can be publicly accessed through [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rohitudageri/credit-card-details?select=Credit_card.csv), although no explaination was given as to how it was assembled or curated. The goal of this project is to make the most accurate possible classifier model with the given data, with consideration for the specific business use case.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Business Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "Approving credit card applications can be a difficult and time consuming process, but using data on previous approvals, we can easily and quickly determine whether or not the bank should approve new applications. This can potentially save financial institutions a significant amount of time, money, and manpower. The coefficients or model weights of the final model may be used to make recommendations about important threshholds in the predictor variables which can be used to guide the approval process. When creating these models, we must be careful to minimize the false positives our model produces, as they are the worst outcome for this purpose and can cost the bank money.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Data Explanation\n",
    "\n",
    "For each record, the data contains:\n",
    " - The gender of the applicant\n",
    " - Whether the applicant owns a car\n",
    " - whether the applicant owns a house or condo\n",
    " - The number of children the applicant has\n",
    " - The applicant's annual income\n",
    " - The source of the applicant's income\n",
    " - Highest level of education achieved by applicant\n",
    " - Marital status of the applicant\n",
    " - Housing type of applicant (if applicable)\n",
    " - A backwards count to the applicant's birthday starting at the day the data was created\n",
    " - A backwards count to the day the applicant became employed (positive value means number of days they have been unemployed)\n",
    " - Whether or not the applicant has a mobile phone\n",
    " - Whether or not the applicant has a work phone\n",
    " - Whether or not the applicant has any other phone number\n",
    " - Whether or not the applicant has an email ID\n",
    " - The type of occupation of the applicant\n",
    " - The number of family members the applicant has\n",
    " - Whether or not the application was approved\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset is rather small, with only 1500 records. This sort of small dataset is unlikely to produce a highly effective model, but it can at least be used to draw inference about what sort of applicants banks should immediately consider approving. The labels are stored in a separate file from the predictors, so we will have to merge them together to ensure the records stay aligned with their labels as we handle missing values and tweak the data."

    "These metrics indicate that we are not really underfitting or overfitting because the model is performing very poorly overall. 33 false negatives is far too many to be acceptable for our business purpose. This issue is likely caused by the fact that there are very few instances of the positive case in the training data and the type of model we trained. Before doing any additional iterations on the type or parameters of the model, let's try applying synthetic minority oversampling (SMOTE) to attempt to correct this issue."

    "The new model has slightly worse recall and precision, and significantly worse accuracy. It is actually correctly identifying some positive cases now, at the cost of a proportionally large increase in false positives. Its f1 score is massively improved, and AUC is slightly improved. For the business purpose of this study, this model is performing better  - now it can actually identify true positives. However, it is far too lenient on who it approves. Let's experiment with parameters, model types, and data engineering techniques to improve it further.\n",

It doubled the number of false positives for only a very small increase in the number of true positives, which is not really worth it for our use case. This analysis did not yeild a significant increase in model performance, so the default parameters and regular data created the model we will use for the rest of the analysis."

    "The best model is a random forest classifier, which makes the task of interpretation quite difficult. The parameters chosen for this model mean that it has 200 individual decision trees that compose it, each contributing to the output of the model. Our best bet to analyze the model is to create a plot of feature importances, or estimated values of how important each feature is to the model. Based on these feature importances, we can make inference about which features banks consider the most important when deciding whether to approve or deny credit card applications."

    "These features allow us to build a profile for the type of person that is frequently approved for credit cards. They are likely in their mid to late twenties - the older they are, the better they are for the bank. The ideal applicant has a steady annual income and has been in their current job for over a year. Having more than two family members is also strongly correlated with the approval of the application.\n",

    "- **Get better data.** In particular, the occupation type category was missing 1/3 of its values that were assumed to represent unemployed. If we knew the real value of these missing records, our model would likely be more accurate.\n",
    "- **Try more modeling techniques.** The three model types tested in this notebook are not the only types of classifier model, and it is probable that other types of classifiers could perform better and yield more interpretable recommendations. "
