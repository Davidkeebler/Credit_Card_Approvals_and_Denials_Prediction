    "# Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "This project attempts to create the best possible binary classification model that can predict whether or not a given individual will qualify for a new credit card based on 17 factors. The data can be publicly accessed through [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rohitudageri/credit-card-details?select=Credit_card.csv), although no explaination was given as to how it was assembled or curated. The goal of this project is to make the most accurate possible classifier model with the given data, with consideration for the specific business use case.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Business Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "Approving credit card applications can be a difficult and time consuming process, but using data on previous approvals, we can easily and quickly determine whether or not the bank should approve new applications. This can potentially save financial institutions a significant amount of time, money, and manpower. The coefficients or model weights of the final model may be used to make recommendations about important threshholds in the predictor variables which can be used to guide the approval process. When creating these models, we must be careful to minimize the false positives our model produces, as they are the worst outcome for this purpose and can cost the bank money.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Data Explanation\n",
    "\n",
    "For each record, the data contains:\n",
    " - The gender of the applicant\n",
    " - Whether the applicant owns a car\n",
    " - whether the applicant owns a house or condo\n",
    " - The number of children the applicant has\n",
    " - The applicant's annual income\n",
    " - The source of the applicant's income\n",
    " - Highest level of education achieved by applicant\n",
    " - Marital status of the applicant\n",
    " - Housing type of applicant (if applicable)\n",
    " - A backwards count to the applicant's birthday starting at the day the data was created\n",
    " - A backwards count to the day the applicant became employed (positive value means number of days they have been unemployed)\n",
    " - Whether or not the applicant has a mobile phone\n",
    " - Whether or not the applicant has a work phone\n",
    " - Whether or not the applicant has any other phone number\n",
    " - Whether or not the applicant has an email ID\n",
    " - The type of occupation of the applicant\n",
    " - The number of family members the applicant has\n",
    " - Whether or not the application was approved\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset is rather small, with only 1500 records. This sort of small dataset is unlikely to produce a highly effective model, but it can at least be used to draw inference about what sort of applicants banks should immediately consider approving. The labels are stored in a separate file from the predictors, so we will have to merge them together to ensure the records stay aligned with their labels as we handle missing values and tweak the data."

    "These metrics indicate that we are not really underfitting or overfitting because the model is performing very poorly overall. 33 false negatives is far too many to be acceptable for our business purpose. This issue is likely caused by the fact that there are very few instances of the positive case in the training data and the type of model we trained. Before doing any additional iterations on the type or parameters of the model, let's try applying synthetic minority oversampling (SMOTE) to attempt to correct this issue."

It doubled the number of false positives for only a very small increase in the number of true positives, which is not really worth it for our use case. This analysis did not yeild a significant increase in model performance, so the default parameters and regular data created the model we will use for the rest of the analysis."

    "The best model is a random forest classifier, which makes the task of interpretation quite difficult. The parameters chosen for this model mean that it has 200 individual decision trees that compose it, each contributing to the output of the model. Our best bet to analyze the model is to create a plot of feature importances, or estimated values of how important each feature is to the model. Based on these feature importances, we can make inference about which features banks consider the most important when deciding whether to approve or deny credit card applications."

    "These features allow us to build a profile for the type of person that is frequently approved for credit cards. They are likely in their mid to late twenties - the older they are, the better they are for the bank. The ideal applicant has a steady annual income and has been in their current job for over a year. Having more than two family members is also strongly correlated with the approval of the application.\n",

    "\n",
    "We recommend that the bank uses these average thresholds as guidelines to determine how to interpret the results of the machine learning model. Applicants above the averages should be reconsidered even if the model initially rejects them, due to the high false negative rate. Applicants that are below the averages can just be safely rejected. \n",
    "\n",
    "Even if the bank rejects the majority of applicants, their classification by this model can still yield useful information. While these individuals may not qualify for this particular credit card, there are likely still many other financial products that they could qualify for. I recommend that the bank to market less risky financial products to these individuals after their credit card applications have been rejected. Alternatively, individuals who are approved by this model could be pre-approved for other financial products that are similarly risky to credit cards, since they are clearly already well-qualified.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another recommendation I can offer the banks is to use these thresholds as a profile for who to market the credit cards to in the first place. They should seek to serve advertisements to individuals who are over the age of 33, have a strong employment history, and make over $165,000 a year that offer them pre-approval on these credit cards. Additionally, individuals who are below the thresholds could be targeted with advertisements for smaller, less-risky lines of credit that help them to build their credit score and eventually qualify for one of these credit cards."

    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "In conclusion, we have created the best possible classifier model with this dataset. It had a recall score of 78% on the testing segment of the data we created. We distilled its predictions into concrete thresholds banks can use to aid their credit card approval process:\n",
    "- **An income of at least of $165,000**\n",
    "- **An age of 33 years**\n",
    "- **At least 3000 days since last change in employment** \n",
    "\n",
    "We recommend that the banks use these thresholds in addition to the machine learning model to fast track qualified applicants, reject underqualified applicants more quickly, and to re-analyze the applications of individuals above the thresholds who are rejected by our model. \n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, we recommend that the banks use the results of this model to build a marketing profile for the type of individual who is likely to qualify for a credit card so they can be served targeted marketing. They could also build a profile for the individuals who are likely to be rejected so they can be served targeted advertising for products that they are more likely to qualify for. \n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, in addition to the marketing efforts to bring in new customers, I would recommend the banks to offer other highly profitable but risky financial products to the applicants who already qualified for the credit cards. The bank has their foot in the door with these individuals, so they are likely to jump at financial opportunities that they are offered. The demographic that is likely to be approved for credit cards is also likely to want a mortgage, which presents an excellent opportunity for the bank to make two sales at once."

    "- **Get more data.** The size of the dataset used to train this model is rather limited, and this in turn limits the accuracy of the model we can use it to create.\n",
    "- **Get better data.** In particular, the occupation type category was missing 1/3 of its values that were assumed to represent unemployed. If we knew the real value of these missing records, our model would likely be more accurate.\n",
    "- **Try more modeling techniques.** The three model types tested in this notebook are not the only types of classifier model, and it is probable that other types of classifiers could perform better and yield more interpretable recommendations. "
